KickStart is a boiler plate for Enterprise Web Applications. It is primarily a front-end solution and can be used with back-end written in any language. In addition the project includes few server side solutions located in "/api" folder. All front-end related source files are in "/web" folder.

## Installation

Before using project tools, you need to install NPM and NodeJS. To install dependencies run:
```
npm install --production             // for production
npm install                          // for development
```

To run development tasks configured in gulpfile.js run:
```
gulp dev
```

### JSON Back-End

Since data is read from static JSON files and cannot be modified, JSON back-end is purely for demo purposes. It is enabled by default. You can change it in "/web/app/home/config.js" file by modifying "context" property.  
If you use Nginx as web server and you have problem with POST request - 405 Not Allowed , there is small hack: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24415376/post-request-not-allowed-405-not-allowed-nginx-even-with-headers-included 
```
#nginx.conf
server {
		listen       80;
		...				
		error_page  403     /403.html;			
		# To allow POST on static pages
		error_page  405     =200 $uri;			
		...
}
```

### NodeJS Back-End

To use NodeJS back-end you need to do a series of steps:
- Install and start MongoDB server (used for session storage)
- Install and start PostgreSQL DB server 
- Run SQL scripts in "/setup" folder
- Change DB configuration in "/api/node/conf.js" file
- Change "context" property to 'http://localhost:3000'

To run NodeJS locally
```
nodemon api/node/start.js
```

To start MongoDB (used for sessions)
```
mongod --dbpath /Users/vitali/Library/MongoDbData &
```
